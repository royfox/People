	We are interested in finding out which teams were the most profitable to bet on during the previous Premier League season (2009/10).

	Here is a link to a CSV file containing data about that season:

	<p>
		<%= @csv_url %>
	</p>
	<p>
	Your task is to write a PHP script that calculates and displays the profit or loss I would have made for each team if I had bet Â£10 with Bet365 on that team to win every game.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note: you may find these columns in the CSV file useful:
	</p>
	<p>
	HomeTeam = Home Team<br />
	AwayTeam = Away Team<br />
	FTHG = Full Time Home Team Goals<br />
	FTAG = Full Time Away Team Goals<br />
	B365H = Bet365 home win odds<br />
	B365D = Bet365 draw odds<br />
	B365A = Bet365 away win odds
	</p>
	<p>
	Please make the script runnable from the command line and output the data to the console
